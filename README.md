This project was created with React Create App, as an exercise during the [OpenClassrooms class on React](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4664381-realisez-une-application-web-avec-react-js/6734471-entrainez-vous-en-creant-un-jeu-du-pendu).

The goal was to create a pendu game. It is actually used now as an exercise for French students to learn neuroscience words.

To test the app locally, you should run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

To deploy on GitHub, you should run:
